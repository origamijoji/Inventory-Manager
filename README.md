# Inventory Management System 
Built using Java 11, JavaFX 17, and Maven.

## Scenario
You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

You have been provided with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system (see the attached “Software 1 GUI Mock-Up”) and a class diagram to assist you in your work (see the attached “UML Class Diagram”). The organization also has specific business requirements that must be considered for the application. A systems analyst created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section of this task based on the business requirements. You will use these solution statements to develop your application.
